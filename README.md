## About:

The C.A.N.G. Physics Simulator is a simulation environment written in C/C++. The simulator allows the user to create and manipulate 2D objects which adhere to various physical laws. Objects are completely modular and can be resized upon placement. Gravity, collisions, chemical reactions and light refraction are all examples of physical attributes which will be implemented.
